## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a fundamental technique in dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. In this repository, we implement PCA using the PyTorch framework, while modeling it as an autoencoder. This approach allows for easy integration with other neural network components and can be used for various tasks, including data compression, feature extraction, and anomaly detection.
